# CRWN Clothing

[Live](https://codicate.github.io/crwn-clothing/)

This project is made from a [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/). The tutorial used class components, javascript, and older redux. 

But I'm too far gone, and I took this as a challenge to remake the app with the current hottest technologies.

"Don't worry, just swallow these dependencies then you will become the hottest app on the block"

_nothing wrong with the technologies used in the tutorial, but if I can I would learn newest technologies and stick to them..._

### Current Technologies used:
- React with hooks
- Redux with Redux Toolkit, reselect, persist
- Typescript
- Sass with module
- styled-components
- react-router
- Firebase
