# E-Commerce-App

This project is made from a tutorial. The tutorial used class components, javascript, and older redux. 

But I'm too far gone, and I took this as a challenge to remake the app with the current hottest technologies.

"Don't worry, just eat these dependencies then you will become the hottest app on the block"

### Current Technologies used:
- React with hooks
- Redux with Redux Toolkit
- Typescript
- Sass with module
- react-router
- Firebase
